#About the Source Data
Quoted from the website - "The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial 
angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has 
been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data." 

#How to Start Data Cleaning and other operations
Download the source data from the given link using the R script, unzip it and start working

#Sequence of operations performed in the R script
a) Start of with loading the dplyr package
b) Creating a directory named data within the working directory
c) Unzip dataSet to /data directory
d) Reading of training and testing data sets
e) Reading feature vector and activity labels vector
f) Assigning column names
g) Merging of Training and Testing Data into one dataset using cbind
h) Merging of both Dataframes into one dataset using rbind
i) Creating a character vector of Column Names and then creating a logical vector containing certain keywords
j) Subsetting the Combined Data using the logical vector
k) Merging with activityLables dataset to give descriptive activity names
l) Creating a second dataset with the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject
m) Writing the data to a text file

#Describing the Variables
a) X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files
b) merge_training, merge_testing the training and testing data frames into 2 standalone data frames
c) CmbndData combines the 2 dataframes from step (b) into a single unified dataframe
d) MeanStd_withNames is obtained from the CmbndData in step (c)
e) aggdata is the second tidy data that aggreagtes the results based on Volunteer Id and activity Id
